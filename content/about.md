## BFH

As a kid at summer camp, one of the counselors told a story about
wrapping an canoe around one of the huge rocks where the South River
dumps into the James in Rockbridge County, Va.  As my hero dragged his
busted ass canoe out of river, one of the local called out to
them.

"Looks like you gonna need a BFH"

"What's that?" they replied.

"Big [expletive] Hammer", the local barked back.

This has always stuck with me as an apt parable of practical
application of technology and disaster.  It served as the title of my
first blog long ago, and though many things have changed since then, I
think it's still a servicable title for a blog about technology,
people and my interactions with the both.
